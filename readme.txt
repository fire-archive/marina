## Readme

The Marina website was created by:

1) Ernest Lee; A00699289; elee225@my.bcit.ca; COMP1A
2) John Lee; johnleebcit@gmail.com; COMP1A

### Completed

We have created a Marina Cafe website that matches the prototype given by the designer and followed the requirements.

### Have not completed

We have not drastically improved the visual design. There has been no compatibility testing on other browsers other than IE9. The PHP submit page does not exist. The email encoding is not really effective. A more effective defence against automated email harvesting is using a captcha or a contact form.

### Challenges

We have had difficulty regarding positioning of elements. 

Also, there was an issue with CSS files being too long to understand. Our solution is to split the styles into separate styles that are accessed with the style.css stylesheet. In the real-world, having multiple stylesheets is not a problem because of the availability of CSS simplifiers to combine all of them to one file and HTTP compression. This was not done for the assignment because a) we wouldn't learn the basics of website development b) the marker has to be able to read the source.

Determining what work to do and who was going to do the work was difficult.
